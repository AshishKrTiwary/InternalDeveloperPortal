Internal Developer Portal

To achieve cloud and infrastructure automation using AWS and Terraform, you can create a developer-friendly Internal Developer Portal (IDP) that allows teams to easily provision and manage resources through a self-service interface. Below is an overview of how this can be done step-by-step, focusing on AWS services, Terraform, and Kubernetes.

1. Setting up Terraform for Infrastructure Automation
Terraform is a powerful tool for infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling you to create blueprints (modules) that developers can reuse to provision infrastructure in a standardized and automated way.

a. Creating Terraform Modules
Terraform modules allow you to create reusable infrastructure templates. These can define things like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, or Kubernetes clusters. Each module should expose input variables that developers can use to customize their environments.

For example, a simple module to provision an EC2 instance: main.tf
